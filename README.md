> [!WARNING]
> **Use with Caution!**  
> This mod is still under development & experimental, issues may raise.

## Lacking Upstream Features
 - Item Rendering Acceleration ([Source](https://github.com/Argon4W/AcceleratedRendering/tree/main/src/main/java/com/github/argon4w/acceleratedrendering/features/items))
   - Mojang has refactored their item-rendering related code in 1.21.4, and current code structure is unsuitable.

## Optional Dependencies
 - [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)
   - Required to open the config screen (Yes we ported the config).
 - [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)
   - Compatibility options for Iris mod are provided.
